This repository contains the analysis code accompanying our study on patient identity signals in the PTB-XL electrocardiography dataset.

The work investigates whether ECG recordings contain reproducible patient-specific structure that may influence artificial intelligence benchmarking strategies.

Due to licensing restrictions, the PTB-XL dataset is not redistributed. Researchers can obtain access via PhysioNet and reproduce all experiments using the scripts provided here.
